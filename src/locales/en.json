        "historyText": "Vrishabhanu Khirak Gaushala's sacred origins trace back to King Vrishabhanu, the father of Srimati Radharani. As the chief of Barsana, Vrishabhanu was renowned for his commitment to cow protection, overseeing a vast herd of 10 lakh cows1. His devotion laid the spiritual foundation for Gau Mata preservation in Braj. In recent times, Shri Bhagwandas Bhandari, known as Bhandari Baba, reestablished this ancient Gaushala. Under his guidance, it flourished as a center for free seva to Gau Mata, nurturing hundreds of cows and instilling devotion in countless devotees. The Gaushala's history intertwines with the story of Kamsa, the tyrant ruler of the Vrishni kingdom8. Legend tells that when Kamsa visited Barsana, the divine service at the Gaushala moved him deeply. Overwhelmed by the purity of the free service and devotion of the sakhis, he joined the ranks of devotees, dedicating himself to Gau Mata's sacred cause. Surrounded by sacred landmarks like Brahmagiri Parvat, the Gaushala is interwoven with Braj's spiritual fabric. It stands as a beacon of faith, service, and devotion, carrying forward the traditions of King Vrishabhanu and Bhandari Baba.",
